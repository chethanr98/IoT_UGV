IoT-based Unmanned Ground Vehicle for Obstacle Detection
Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) are robotic platforms that are used as an extension of human capability. This type of robots are generally capable of operating outdoors and over a wide variety of terrain, functioning in place of human. The aim of our project is to design and implement a prototype of an unmanned ground vehicle which can detect the obstacles in the path of challenging environments. The vehicle comprises of ultrasonic sensors to detect the obstacle blocking the path and GPS to know the exact location of a particular obstacle. The UGV collects information of the surroundings using gas and temperature sensors which are mounted on the vehicle. This information collected can be sent to the authorities concerned through IoT, for further action. This project thus focuses on developing a semiautonomous vehicle which can be used in war field and during natural calamities to assess the acts as a first hand informer regarding the status of situation without endangering the life of rescue personnel.
